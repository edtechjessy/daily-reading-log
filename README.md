# Reading Log Project

## My Purpose
I am using this log as part of my homeschooling journey, specifically utilizing the **Discovery K-12** platform without paying for the parent service and keeping track of my kid's daily reading this year. While Google Forms could offer a simpler solution, I wanted to make the process more visually appealing and interactive by adding star ratings and emotional feedback.

## Why You Should Use it Too
This project is a responsive, visually appealing reading log form designed for use with Formspree. It allows students or users to submit their daily reading information, including book details, a rating, and their feelings about the reading. The form integrates custom styling, a star-rating system, and a feelings selector to make the experience interactive and fun.

## Track

- **Book Title**
- **Author**
- **Page Numbers** (Start and End)
- **Summary** of what they've read
- **Interactive Star Rating**
     - Users can select a star rating from 1 to 10 based on their enjoyment
        - JavaScript is used to handle the "fill effect" when stars are clicked.  
       - This creates a visually engaging way for users to rate their books.
- **Feelings**         
  - Users can choose from a list of emotions (e.g., Angry, Happy, Excited) to describe how they felt about the book. 
    - Hover and selection effects are applied to make the interaction more intuitive.

## Formspree Integration  
   - The form action was updated to send data via Formspree. This enables submissions to be emailed directly to a specified email address for FREE (limited to 50 submissions a month on the free plan).  
   - Field names were added to match Formspree's format (name, email, etc.).

## Improvements

### 1. *Formspree Integration*
   - *What was added:* Updated the <form> action attribute to point to Formspree's API endpoint and renamed form field names to use Formspree's naming conventions.  
   - *Why:* To enable email-based form submissions *without requiring a backend server*.  

### 2. *JavaScript for Star Ratings*
   - *What was added:* A script to toggle the "filled" state of stars based on the userâ€™s selection.  
   - *Why:* To make the rating system visually interactive and user-friendly.

### 3. *Improved Accessibility*
   - *What was added:* ARIA attributes (aria-label) for the feelings selector radio buttons and keyboard support for the star ratings.  
   - *Why:* To ensure the form is accessible for all users, including those using screen readers.

### 4. *Enhanced Styling*
   - *What was added:* Hover and focus states for buttons, radio inputs, and stars; better padding and alignment for elements.  
   - *Why:* To provide a polished, professional design that improves user experience.

## Future Improvements

- Add **emotional faces** to the "feelings" section of the form to enhance user interaction and make it even more engaging (not just words that shade to a color when chosen) similar to the pain scale chart.
